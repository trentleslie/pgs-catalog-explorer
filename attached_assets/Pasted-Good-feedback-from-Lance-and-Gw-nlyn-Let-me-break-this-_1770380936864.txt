Good feedback from Lance and Gwênlyn. Let me break this down into actionable items and research the GWAS question:Good, I found the key information. Let me compile the feedback breakdown:

## Feedback Breakdown from DS Meeting

### Issue 1: Lance — Add GWAS information (sample size, year) for filtering

**Data availability:** Yes, the PGS Catalog API provides this. Each score has `samples_variants` (GWAS source samples) and `samples_training` (PGS development samples) objects containing:
- `sample_number` — total individuals
- `sample_cases` / `sample_controls` — for case-control studies  
- `ancestry_broad` — ancestry category
- `source_GWAS_catalog` — link to GWAS Catalog study ID if available

The publication year is already in the publication object (`date_publication`).

**Solution for Replit agent:**
```
Feature request: GWAS sample size and year filters

Add the following filters to the Scores tab sidebar:

1. **GWAS Sample Size filter** (range slider)
   - Extract total sample count from score['samples_variants'] 
   - Sum sample_number across all GWAS source samples
   - Range slider from 0 to max in catalog (~5M)
   - Display as "GWAS N: 10,000 - 500,000"

2. **Publication Year filter** (range slider or dropdown)
   - Extract from publication['date_publication'] 
   - Range: 2008 to 2026

3. **Show these values in the scores table:**
   - Add columns: gwas_n, pub_year
   - These help users quickly assess score quality (larger GWAS = better effect estimates, newer = better methods)

The data is available in the API — check the `samples_variants` array on each score for GWAS sample info.
```

### Issue 2: Gwênlyn — Traits tab doesn't show PGS IDs except in CSV download

**The problem:** User searches traits, finds matches, but can't see which PGS IDs are associated without downloading CSV.

**Solution for Replit agent:**
```
UX fix: Show PGS IDs in Traits tab results

When displaying trait search results, include the associated PGS IDs in the table/display, not just in the CSV export. Options:

1. Add a "PGS IDs" column to the trait results table showing comma-separated IDs (with clickable links)
2. Or add an expandable row that shows all associated PGS when clicked
3. Or when a trait row is selected, populate a "Scores for this trait" panel below the table

The goal: users should be able to see which scores exist for a trait without having to download CSV.
```

### Issue 3: Gwênlyn — Performance Metrics tab doesn't respond to PGS ID search

**The problem:** Entering a PGS ID in Performance Metrics tab and hitting enter does nothing. But if you search in Scores tab first, then Performance Metrics populates.

**Root cause:** The Performance Metrics tab might be waiting for score selection from the Scores tab rather than accepting direct PGS ID input.

**Solution for Replit agent:**
```
Bug fix: Performance Metrics tab should accept direct PGS ID search

The Performance Metrics tab has a search input but doesn't respond when a PGS ID is entered directly. It only populates after selecting a score from the Scores tab.

Fix: Make the Performance Metrics tab search work independently (same pattern as the Publications tab fix we just did):
1. When user enters a PGS ID and hits enter/clicks search
2. Call GET /rest/performance/search?pgs_id={pgs_id} directly  
3. Display all evaluation metrics for that score
4. Don't require the user to visit Scores tab first
```

### Issue 4: Gwênlyn — Score Details shows "dist; count" for Ancestry Coverage

**The problem:** Screenshot shows literal text "dist; count" instead of actual values under Ancestry Coverage for PGS004237.

**Root cause:** The template placeholders aren't being populated with real data. This is either:
- The ancestry data isn't being fetched for that score
- The display logic has a bug where it shows variable names instead of values

**Solution for Replit agent:**
```
Bug fix: Ancestry Coverage shows "dist; count" instead of actual values

In Score Details for PGS004237, the Ancestry Coverage section shows:
- Development: dist; count  
- Evaluation: dist; count

These are placeholder strings, not actual data. Fix the display logic to:
1. Fetch ancestry data from the score's samples_variants (development) and from evaluations (evaluation)
2. Display actual counts and ancestry distribution, e.g.:
   - Development: European (100%, N=50,000)
   - Evaluation: European (80%), East Asian (20%), N=15,000 across 3 cohorts
3. If no ancestry data is available, show "Not reported" instead of template placeholders
```

**Summary for Replit agent — all four issues:**

1. **GWAS filters** — Add GWAS sample size (from `samples_variants`) and publication year filters to Scores tab
2. **Traits tab PGS IDs** — Show associated PGS IDs in the trait results, not just in CSV export  
3. **Performance Metrics search** — Make direct PGS ID search work without requiring Scores tab first
4. **Ancestry placeholders** — Fix "dist; count" showing instead of actual ancestry data in Score Details
